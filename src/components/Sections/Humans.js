                <p className="nature-info">If Animals are a miracle to existence, our capacity to reason is the most marvelous thing of evolution. But this reasoning is a double edge sword and with the development of history, our talent to create together with our capacity to plan, has created cities, and factories, and changed how we live on Earth, being disattached to it. 
                Now, capitalism forces us to keep on producing, keep on buying, to the illusion of creatings we don't need. Moreover, this created need is destroying wildlife, environments and also people less fortunate that are forced to work to create these objects we donâ€™t need. In order to save the planet, we need to create a new relationship with ourselves and to other humans, and when we respect everyone, we will take action forever.
