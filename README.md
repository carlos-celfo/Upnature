Project Name: 
Upnature

Description:
80% of teenagers are passionate about making an impact on our planet, but do not learn how to in school (Source: Independent). This means that a lot of ideas dedicated to improving sustainability, will not be executed and thus go to waste. 

With Upnature, we have designed a website that allows school children to learn about sustainability and get inspired. 
Via the Forms on the website, pupils can also hand in their ideas on making an impact and get visible
In turn, other visitors of the website can support these project ideas and make them come true.

Upnature provides teenagers the opportunity to get inspired by information on sustainability as well as post their own ideas tackling today’s sustainability challenges, by gaining visibility and supporters to make their ideas come to life. We believe that every small action towards making the planet a better and more sustainable environment counts and want to give these actions a platform to be more effective. 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run (first install, then start):

### npm install

will install all the dependencies in the package.json

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
